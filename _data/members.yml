His research focuses on the interplay between soft ordered materials and the constraints imposed by a confining volume. Perry received his B.S. in Physics from Harvey Mudd College in 2011 where he worked on characterizing cathode materials for high speed electron microscopy. He is a trainee in the NSF IGERT FLAMEL program and in his free time he enjoys climbing rocks and being outside.
