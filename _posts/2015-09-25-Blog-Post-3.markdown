# What is this post?
This is a brief recap of my 1st presentation in class. This post will cover some of the technical details I presented on as well as serving as a place to leave comments.

# Redux

## Why curvature and why a torus?
The active nematic material we are working with is a *soft* material. This implies that it is easily deformed and thus sensitive to forces that *hard* materials can easily ignore.  Macroscopic curvature is one of these forces. In fact, the connection between nematic order (specifically in thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals) and curvature is well-studied and actually lies at the heart of the free-energy typically used to evaluate nematic configurations.

We are looking at active nematics on the surface of a torus becuase the torus gives us an opportunity to examine the effect of changing curvature.  Unlike a sphere, the curvature on the surface of a torus changes depending on the location. For example, a torus will always have a smoothly varying Gaussian curvature between its maxmimum along the outer ring and its minimum along the inner ring. In addition, the maximum Gaussian curvature is always positive and the minimum Gaussian curvature is always negative.

## How do we analyze the data
In the last post, I determined that the microstructure function is the nematic order paramter, ***Q***, a symmetric traceless rank-2 tensor.  As a brief aside, we use a rank-2 tensor due to the head-tail symmetry of the nematic structure. If we tried to define a vector (rank-1 tensor) for the nematic, we would always find that the vector was 0. 

To determine ***Q*** everywhere in our data, we first use a technique called "Coherence-enhanced diffusion filtering." The basic idea is to make an averaged rank-2 tensor from the gradient of the image intensity. This gives us a good idea of the local orientation everywhere in the image. We then average over thse local orientations to find ***Q***. An example analysis showing how we move from the raw data to the microstructure function is below.

 1. First, we take our 3D (x,y,z) array of data and project it to a 2D (x,y) array by only keeping the maximum intensity along z for each (x,y) coordinate. Above, a video scanning through the 3D array along z is seen on the left and the maximum intensity projection for a portion of the torus is seen on the right.



# What do we want?
For this project, we are going to treat variables like the curvature of the substrate, the activity of the material, the size of the torus, etc., as **processes** that potentially have an impact on the **structure** of the nematic. In this context, we are looking for a **process-structure relationship**.

# The microstructure function
Since we are dealing with a nematic material, we need a function that can characterize not only the director "**n**", but also the degree of alignment "S."  As mentioned in the Project Introduction, the director is a bivector that characterizes the local average orientation of the nematogens and can take values from [0,180) degrees.  If "**n**" can be seen as the mean of an orientation distribution, "S" can be thought of as the width of that distribution. It characterizes how well the individual molecules align along "**n**". These two quantities are encapsulated in the nematic order parameter "***Q***", a traceless, symmetric rank 2 tensor defined in 3 dimensions as:
$$
\mathit{Q}_{ij} = S \left ( n_i n_j-\frac{1}{3}\delta_{ij}\right ) = \left \langle u_i^{\alpha} u_j^{\alpha}-\frac{1}{3}\delta_{ij} \right \rangle_{\alpha},
$$
where **u** is the orientation of an individual nematogen and the ensemble average is carried out over a local region. We will use ***Q*** as our microstructure function. Thus, if we can find the orientation of our nematic everywhere on the surface, we can compute ***Q***, obtaining our microstructure function.

This leads to the next question: how do I get the nematic orientation from my data?
