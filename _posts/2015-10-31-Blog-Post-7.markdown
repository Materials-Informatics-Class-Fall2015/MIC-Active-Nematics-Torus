# What is this post?
This will cover how I determine the number of componenets to use when representing my microstructure using a continuous basis function  (rather than just the primative basis)

# Our bases
We use both the Legendre polynomials (to represent the degree of alignment) and a Fourier series.  The Legendre polynomial basis is already implremented in PyMKS. The Fourier basis is not yet integrated into the distributed PyMKS, but I have the most updated version (written by David) to use for my data.
