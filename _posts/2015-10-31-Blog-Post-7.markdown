# What is this post?
This will cover how I determine the number of componenets to use when representing my microstructure using a continuous basis function  (rather than just the primative basis)

# Our bases
We use both the Legendre polynomials (to represent the degree of alignment) and a Fourier series.  The Legendre polynomial basis is already implremented in PyMKS. The Fourier basis is not yet integrated into the distributed PyMKS, but I have the most updated version (written by David) to use for my data.
The data are discretized such that $$ \frac{1}{\Delta} \integral_s m(h,x) dx = \sum_l m[l,s] \Zeta_l (h) $$, where $$m$$, $$h$$, $$s$$, and $$x$$ are the ususal variables to represent the microstate probability, the microstate itself, the discrete spatial bin, and the continuous spatial position, respectively. Here, $$l$$ represents the discrete local state, and $$\Zeta_l(h)$$ is the appropriate orthogonal basis function. In this way we recast the original state space into the state space of the orthogonal function basis where each value of $$l$$ corresponds to a state in the new basis.  For the degree of alignment we use the legendre polynomials, $$\Zeta_l (h)  = P_l (h) = \frac{1}{2^l l!} \frac{d^l}{dh^n} \left [  (h^2 -1)^l\right ]. For the orientation, we use a Fourier series, $$ \Zeta_l (h) = \exp(i*\frac{2*pi*l*h}{P})$$, where P is the periodicity of the data. In our case, P is $$\pi$$.

Note that for N states, the Legendre polynomials have $$l$$ range from $$0$$ to $$N-1$$ while for the Fourier series $$l$$ ranges from $$-(N-1)/2$$ to $$(N-1)/2$$.
