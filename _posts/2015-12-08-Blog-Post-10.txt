#Project Intro


## The Dataset


# Cleaning the images

# Challenges


## What should we look at?


## Implementing the Fourier Basis


## How many terms in the Fourier Series should we use?



# Preliminary results



Story is this:
Active nematics present an interesting way to examine ordered materials that are out-of-equilibrium. Nematics are blah, active are blah. what does this mean?  Can we predict trajectories?  Why does anybody care?

Link to dataset posts.

Motivate cleaning with microstructure function and need to  properly resolve distance

How do we do statistics in a reasonable matter when spatial position could matter?

Need for Fourier basis to resolve periodic structure and how we implemented it

How many terms do we need as we seem to capture little variation

Prelim results. Can resolve differnet toroids in the 1st three components. Next will try manually reducing the dimensions and using nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
