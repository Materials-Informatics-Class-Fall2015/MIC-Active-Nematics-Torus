#Project Intro
This project centers around the time evolution of an active nematic material on the surface of a torus. We define an active material as a material whose individual components have a source of internal energy that is converted into kinetic energy. Nematic materials are an ordered material composed of elongated units who share a preferred alignment direction. We refer to this direction as the director, **n**. In equilibruim with no external perturbation, a nematic material will have a uniformly aligned ground state; however, external influences such as confinement, applied fields, flow, etc can produce states with defects, or places where the **n** is undefined. A schematic of how a director is defined as well as director maps of two differnt defect types can be seen in the figure from the [Introduction Post](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-Active-Nematics-Torus/2015/09/09/Blog-Post-1/) can be seen below.

Active nematics present an interesting way to examine ordered materials that are constantly driven out-of-equilibrium.  A snapshot of an active nematic can be seen in the figure above. Note the large number of $$+ 1/2$$ and $$- 1/2$$ defects in the sample.  This is due to activity-induced flow distorting the preferred uniform ground state. More about the specific active nematic system we use and some of its fundamental science applications can be found [here](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7424/full/nature11591.html) and [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6201/1135). Specifically, we wish to look at active nematics on the surface of a torus; there are many connections between equilibrium nematics and topology/curvature. For example, [this study](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v7/n5/full/nphys1920.html) looking at equilibrium spherical nematic shells and [this study](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/23/9295) looking at bulk equilibrium nematic toroids. As seen [here]((http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6201/1135)), active nematic spheres have been studied and a correspondence was found between the active case and the equilibrium case. We hope that studying active nematics on a torus will lead to insights not only concenrning the equilibrium ground state of a nematic on a torus, but will also lead to insights in non-equilibrium physics.

To do this, we start with the goal of characterizing the time-evolution of the structure of the active nematic on the surface of a torus.

## The Dataset
Our data are collected with a confocal microscope; thus, we have intensity data in a 3-D (x,y,z) array.  Below left is a scan of an example array through the z-direction, and below right is a video rotating the array to show that we do have a nematic on the surface of a torus.

Both of these images come from the same dataset - it is a single image in time of a single torus.  For the time-evolution data, we are going to project the data along the z-axis to form a 2-D image (x,y). A video of the time evolution of such a projection for a small portion of the the torus is below.

The above video is one of the datasets we wish to charaacterize. We have 2 other videos like the above video, but for different toroids with different sizes and aspect ratios. More info can be found in the [Introduction Post](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-Active-Nematics-Torus/2015/09/09/Blog-Post-1/).

# Cleaning the images
To track the time-evolution of the structure, we first need a way to characterize the structure. We do this using the tensor nematic order parameter ***Q***, as defined in [this post](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-Active-Nematics-Torus/2015/09/21/Blog-Post-2/). Since ***Q*** is a tensor, we need 2 quantities to define the structure at every point. We will use the **n** as defined earlier and "S", the degree of alignment. A more in-depth description as well as our methodology for determining **n** and "S" from the raw data can be found in [this post](http://materials-informatics-class-fall2015.github.io/MIC-Active-Nematics-Torus/2015/09/25/Blog-Post-3/). Once the images are clean, we have an **n** image and an "S" image for each raw data image, as seen in the example below:

![Example to show data projection to nematic order parameter](/MIC-Active-Nematics-Torus/img/post5/Start.png)

The **n** image shows the orientation of the director on the interval [0 degrees, 180 degrees] measured clockwise off of the horizontal axis.  The "S" image holds the degree of alignment and can take values from [0,1]. 

The next step to cleaning the images is to unwrap them; since we have projected a curved surface in 3-D to a flat 2-D plane, distance is no accurately represented in the projections. This will be a problem for computing statistics. Thus, we will "unwrap" our projected images such that the area on the surface of the torus is preserved in the 2-D plane. An example unwrapping can be seen in the below image. 

![Example to show unwrapping](/MIC-Active-Nematics-Torus/img/post5/Unwrap_1.png)

The highlighed contours and colored endpoints correspond to each other. Note how even though we've unwrapped one curvature, we haven't yet projected length properly. The schematic above just serves as a useful graphic to demonstrate part of the unwrapping process. Our final process rescales the unwrapped image to properly represent data, as seen below for a series of binary mask images.

# Challenges


## What should we look at?


## Implementing the Fourier Basis


## How many terms in the Fourier Series should we use?



# Preliminary results



Story is this:
Active nematics present an interesting way to examine ordered materials that are out-of-equilibrium. Nematics are blah, active are blah. what does this mean?  Can we predict trajectories?  Why does anybody care?

Link to dataset posts.

Motivate cleaning with microstructure function and need to  properly resolve distance

How do we do statistics in a reasonable matter when spatial position could matter?

Need for Fourier basis to resolve periodic structure and how we implemented it

How many terms do we need as we seem to capture little variation

Prelim results. Can resolve differnet toroids in the 1st three components. Next will try manually reducing the dimensions and using nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
